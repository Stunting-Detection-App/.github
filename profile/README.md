## 📚 Project Description
In Indonesia, stunting is still one of the major public health concerns. According to the results of the 2023 Indonesia Health Survey, or SKI, the prevalence of stunting or growth failure among Indonesian children stands at 21.5%, with over 4.5 million children under five years of age. This makes stunting the most prevalent form of malnutrition in the country, with more than 2 million children suffering from severe wasting and 7 million children under five experiencing stunting, conditions that were prevalent even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.

Various reasons can be identified for this trend in stunted growth among Indonesian children. This includes the inability of Indonesian children to take up appropriate levels of nutrients, which mostly pertains to insufficient levels of proteins, calories, and micronutrients like Vitamin A, iron, and zinc necessary for proper growth and development. Besides this, there is limited awareness on the part of parents to prevent stunting, coupled with ignorance on appropriate nutrition and food measurement. Many families are also facing limited access to vital information about stunting and its prevention.

To this effect, our team is working on an innovative application aimed at assisting parents in tracking their children's growth. The application will utilize age, gender, and height measurements as key parameters in predicting the possibility of stunting. It will also provide appropriate dietary advice for both stunted and non-stunted children, thus making it easier for parents to make decisions regarding their children's nutrition. This user-friendly tool aims to bridge the information gap and empower parents with practical solutions for maintaining their children's healthy growth and development.
